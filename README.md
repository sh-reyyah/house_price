# 🏡 House Price Prediction

## 📌 Overview
This project aims to predict **house prices** using machine learning models based on various factors such as crime rate, number of rooms, and proximity to essential locations. The dataset used is the **Boston Housing Dataset**.

## 🚀 Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, feature scaling, and encoding.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Understanding data distributions and correlations.
- **Machine Learning Models**:
  - Linear Regression
  - Random Forest
  - Gradient Boosting
- **Model Evaluation**: Performance metrics such as MAE, MSE, and R² score.
- **Visualization**: Actual vs. Predicted price comparison.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset contains key features like:
- **CRIM**: Per capita crime rate by town.
- **RM**: Average number of rooms per dwelling.
- **LSTAT**: % lower status population.
- **PTRATIO**: Pupil-teacher ratio.
- **MEDV**: Median value of owner-occupied homes (target variable).

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Python** 🐍
- **Pandas & NumPy** (Data Manipulation)
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (Visualization)
- **Scikit-Learn** (Machine Learning)

## 📊 Results
- **Gradient Boosting** and **Random Forest** performed better than Linear Regression.
- **Prediction Function:** You can input custom house features and get price predictions.
- **Feature engineering** played a crucial role in performance enhancement.

## 🔧 Installation & Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/house-price-prediction.git
   cd house-price-prediction
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
